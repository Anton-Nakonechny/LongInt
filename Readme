Class LongInt used to operate with Long integer numbers.
Bits are stored in least significant order.

class Digits is used for input/output purposes.
It is a simple inefficient (in terms of memory consumption) vector.
One byte is used per digit.
Digits are stored in vector in reverse order too,
this way lots of memory reallocations avoided during bin->dec and dec->bin convertion.

Make will compile simple unit tests
Google unit test framework is used.
Pretty short ubuntu instalation guide for test framework is on the web:
